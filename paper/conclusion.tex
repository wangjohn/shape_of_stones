In this paper, we presented two models which could determine how stones are shaped by erosion. The first model was a discrete model based off of a mechanism for chipping a stone via shear forces. The second model was a continuous model that used Fourier transforms to model a stone being worn down. Each model targets a different aspect of erosion, and taken together, one can better understand the actual mechanism for the erosion of stones.

Natural directions for future research include generalizing both our discrete and continuous models to higher dimensions. In addition, the discrete model could be extended so that the amount of area chipped depends on the iteration in the chipping process.
