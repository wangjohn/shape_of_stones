In this paper, we presented two models which could determine how stones are shaped by erosion. The first model was a discrete model based off of a mechanism for chipping a stone via shear forces. The second model was a continuous model that used Fourier transforms to model a stone being worn down. Each model targets a different aspect of erosion, and taken together, one can better understand the actual mechanism for the erosion of stones.
